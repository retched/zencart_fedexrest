### Developer Resources

- [Rates API](https://developer.fedex.com/api/en-mx/catalog/rate.html#/api)


This module uses [FedEx's RESTful API](https://developer.fedex.com/api/en-mx/catalog.html).

As such, it replaces the older [FedEx Web Services plugin](https://www.zen-cart.com/downloads.php?do=file&id=1784), which was based on the (now deprecated) XML API.

### Configuration 

If your goal is to match the [FedEx Online Rating Tool](https://www.fedex.com/en-us/online/rating.html#), please note: the online tool quotes "counter rates," which are not available either from the REST API or the older Web Services API.  

You can get close to their rates for most services (Ground is a notable exception) with these settings: 

- In the online rating tool: 
  - Enter the ship from and to addresses, the weight and number of packages.  Leave all other settings at their default values.   Be sure the weight and number of packages matches exactly what Zen Cart is using.
  - Be sure the checkbox for "I want this shipment picked up" is unchecked (e.g. you want drop off)
  - Be sure the checkbox for "shipping to a residence" is unchecked.

- In Zen Cart Admin settings for FedEx REST (this module): 
  - Ship From address is residential = false
  - Ship To address is residential = false
  - Pickup type = 3
  - Signature Option = -1 
  - Insurance = -1 
  - FedEx Rates = LIST 

<hr>
If your goal is to match the older FedEx Web Services plugin, use these settings:

- In the Zen Cart Admin settings for the older FedEx Web Services plugin: 
  - Enable Address Validation = false
  - Drop off type to 1 or 3. 
  - FedEx Rates = LIST 

- In Zen Cart Admin settings for FedEx REST (this module): 
  - Ship From address is residential = false
  - Ship To address is residential = true 
  - Pickup type = 1 or 3, based on whichever value is used in older module Drop off type setting
  - Signature Option = -1 
  - Insurance = 0 
  - FedEx Rates = LIST 

Note that you must test with items that are not free shipping and do not use the Numinix "ready to ship" flag.  Those features are not supported by this plugin. 
Be sure the FedEx Account Number, ship from address, etc. for the old and new shipping modules have the same values to get an apples-to-apples comparison.
